Problem 1B
----------
Difference in execution time and the time spent in READY state is observed when more CPU
cores are tasked with running the OS simulation. 2 CPU cores spend 37.2s executing and 33.1s
in the READY state. Increasing the CPU cores to 4, reduces this time to 33.2 s and 0s respectively.
Thus, we can conlcude that there is a linear relationship between the number of CPUs and the total
execution time.

Problem 2B
----------
Running the scheduler with time slices 200, 400, 600 and 800ms it is observed that 
execution time remains constant, context-switch time increases
and time spent in ready state decreases minutely.

Problem 3B
----------
Running each of the three scheduling algorithms using one cpu, it is observed that Static
Priority is the closest to SJF because in SJF processes are given ranks based on their 
remaining time and the processes with the highest ranks get priority which is almost 
the same case in Static Priority.
